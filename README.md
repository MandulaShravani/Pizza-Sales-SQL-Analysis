# Pizza-Sales-SQL-Analysis
This project showcases my ability to retrieve and analyze data from a relational database using SQL.
I worked with a Pizza Sales dataset containing multiple related tables(orders,order_details,pizzas,pizza_types).

The project is divided into Basic, Intermediate, and Advanced query challenges, covering a wide range of SQL skills:
Joining multiple tables to combine related information.
Using aggregate functions to calculate totals, averages, and maximum values.
Grouping and filtering data with GROUP BY and HAVING.
Writing subqueries to solve complex analytical problems.
Implementing window functions to compute cumulative metrics over time.

The goal of this project was to extract meaningful insights such as total revenue, most popular pizzas, sales trends over time, and category-wise performance â€” demonstrating my proficiency in SQL for real-world data analysis.
